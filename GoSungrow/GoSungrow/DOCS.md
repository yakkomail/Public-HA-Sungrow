5. Set the config options.

![Install add-on](https://github.com/MickMake/HomeAssistantAddons/raw/main/GoSungrow/docs/ScreenShot6.png)

The following options are mandatory:
- sungrow_user
- sungrow_password - Make sure you have created your account at https://isolarcloud.com/

- sungrow_mqtt_user
- sungrow_mqtt_password - Enter in your login details for HA.

You may have to set the following options. As of v3.0.x if you leave the blank, it'll autoconfigure:
- sungrow_mqtt_host
- sungrow_mqtt_port

The rare occasion:
- sungrow_host - May need to be changed depending on which global server you connect to.
- sungrow_appkey - Just don't. Really don't, but if you want to hack. Then do!
- sungrow_timeout - Useful if your iSolarCloud global gateway is slow/unreachable.
- sungrow_debug - If you REALLY want to see some noise. Just leave it unset.

5. Start it up!

## Lovelace examples

[These are the Lovelace YAML files](https://github.com/MickMake/HomeAssistantAddons/raw/main/GoSungrow/docs/lovelace) and images I use for my HA instance:

You'll need to modify the ps_id and ps_keys within these files to display the correct info. Any text editor can do a global search and replace.

You can use the GoSungrow tool to get this info:

`GoSungrow show ps tree`

Also grab the images from the [images directory](https://github.com/MickMake/HomeAssistantAddons/raw/main/GoSungrow/docs/lovelace/images) and place them in your /config/www directory.


## HA's Energy Dashboard

To use HA's Energy Dashboard, you'll need to find the following entries. Make sure to replace `XXXXXXXXXXXXXX` with your ps_key.

### Electricity grid

- sensor.gosungrow_virtual_XXXXXXXXXXXXXX_grid_to_load_energy
- sensor.gosungrow_virtual_XXXXXXXXXXXXXX_pv_to_grid_energy

### Solar Panels
- sensor.gosungrow_virtual_XXXXXXXXXXXXXX_pv_energy

### Home Battery Storage
- sensor.gosungrow_virtual_XXXXXXXXXXXXXX_battery_discharge_energy
- sensor.gosungrow_virtual_XXXXXXXXXXXXXX_battery_charge_energy
